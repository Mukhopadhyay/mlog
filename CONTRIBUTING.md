### Write Documentation
The driving force behind this project is to keep it simple and very easily understadable, so any contribution on documentation or usage examples are much appreciated. For this project we use [**mkdocs-material**](https://squidfunk.github.io/mkdocs-material/) on top of [**mkdocs**](https://www.mkdocs.org/). You'll find all the documentation inside the `docs` directory and the main configuration file `mkdocs.yml` in the root of the project.
